# Enhanced Config-Driven UI Restaurant App

This project is an enhanced Restaurant Listing application built using ReactJS. It demonstrates the use of config-driven UI, where the UI is dynamically generated based on configuration data. This version includes a search functionality and utilizes React hooks such as `useState`.

## Key Features

1. **React Components**: Understanding the structure and behavior of functional components.
2. **JSX Syntax**: Using JSX to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.
3. **Props**: Passing data to components via props.
4. **JavaScript in React**: Utilizing JavaScript within React components for dynamic rendering.
5. **CSS Styling**: Applying styles to components using CSS.
6. **Keys**: Using keys to help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.
7. **Config-Driven UI**: Using real restaurant data to drive the UI configuration.
8. **Destructuring**: Utilizing JavaScript destructuring for cleaner code.
9. **Search Functionality**: Implementing a search bar to filter restaurants by name.
10. **React Hooks**: Using `useState` for state management.
