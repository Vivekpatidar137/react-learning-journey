## Question 1: What is the difference between Named Export, Default export and * as export?

**Answer**:

- **Named exports** are ideal for exporting multiple functionalities from a module, providing clear names for each export.
- **Default exports** are suitable for exporting the core functionality of a module, allowing flexible naming during import.
- **Avoid `* as` export** in React as it can lead to naming conflicts and make code less readable. Opt for named or default exports for better organization.

## Question 2: What is the importance of config.js file?

**Answer**:

The `config.js` file (or a similarly named configuration file) is a valuable tool in React applications for centralizing important settings and configurations. Here's a breakdown of its significance:

**Centralized Configuration:**

- Acts as a central hub for storing all your application's configuration data, making it easier to manage and maintain.
- Keeps configuration logic separate from your React components, promoting cleaner code.

**Environment-Specific Configurations:**

- Allows you to define different configurations for development, testing, and production environments. This enables you to use environment variables (e.g., API URLs) that can be easily switched depending on the deployment environment.
- This improves security by keeping sensitive information (like API keys) out of your source code and potentially out of version control.

**Improved Maintainability:**

- By storing configurations in one place, you can easily update them without modifying your React components.
- Makes the codebase cleaner and easier for other developers to understand.

**Specific Use Cases (e.g., Next.js):**

- In frameworks like Next.js, `config.js` plays a crucial role in enabling Server-Side Rendering (SSR). This technique enhances Search Engine Optimization (SEO) by providing search engines with fully rendered HTML pages.
- It can also facilitate customization of build settings, routing, and other framework-specific features.

**However, there are some things to keep in mind:**

- **Security:** Never store sensitive data (like passwords or API keys) directly in your `config.js` file. Consider environment variables for those.
- **Overuse:** While `config.js` is useful, don't overload it with configuration that might be better placed within components themselves.

In summary, the `config.js` file is a powerful tool for managing configurations in React applications. It promotes code organization, maintains separate settings for different environments, and enhances maintainability. By using it effectively, you can create well-structured and adaptable React applications.

## Question 3: What are React Hooks?

**Answer**:

React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Introduced in React 16.8, Hooks provide a more direct API to the React concepts you already know. Here are some key points about React Hooks:

1. **useState**:
    - **Purpose**: Allows you to add state to functional components.
    - **Syntax**: `const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);`
    - **Example**:

    ```jsx
    import React, { useState } from 'react';

    function Counter() {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

      return (
        <div>
          <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
          <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

2. **useEffect**:
    - **Purpose**: Allows you to perform side effects in functional components (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions).
    - **Syntax**: `useEffect(() => { /* effect */ }, [dependencies]);`
    - **Example**:

    ```jsx
    import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

    function Example() {
      const [data, setData] = useState(null);

      useEffect(() => {
        fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
          .then(response => response.json())
          .then(data => setData(data));
      }, []);

      return <div>{data ? JSON.stringify(data) : 'Loading...'}</div>;
    }
    ```

3. **useContext**:
    - **Purpose**: Lets you subscribe to React context without introducing nesting.
    - **Syntax**: `const value = useContext(MyContext);`
    - **Example**:

    ```jsx
    import React, { useContext } from 'react';

    const MyContext = React.createContext();

    function MyComponent() {
      const value = useContext(MyContext);
      return <div>{value}</div>;
    }
    ```

4. **useReducer**:
    - **Purpose**: An alternative to `useState` for managing more complex state logic.
    - **Syntax**: `const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);`
    - **Example**:

    ```jsx
    import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

    const initialState = { count: 0 };

    function reducer(state, action) {
      switch (action.type) {
        case 'increment':
          return { count: state.count + 1 };
        case 'decrement':
          return { count: state.count - 1 };
        default:
          throw new Error();
      }
    }

    function Counter() {
      const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
      return (
        <div>
          Count: {state.count}
          <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
          <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

5. **Custom Hooks**:
    - **Purpose**: Allows you to create reusable hooks to share logic across components.
    - **Syntax**: Custom hooks are regular functions that can use other hooks.
    - **Example**:

    ```jsx
    import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

    function useFetch(url) {
      const [data, setData] = useState(null);
      const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

      useEffect(() => {
        fetch(url)
          .then(response => response.json())
          .then(data => {
            setData(data);
            setLoading(false);
          });
      }, [url]);

      return { data, loading };
    }
    ```

## Question 4: Why do we need a `useState` Hook?

**Answer**:

The `useState` hook is essential because it allows functional components in React to manage state, which was previously only possible in class components. It simplifies the code by reducing boilerplate and enhances readability. `useState` aligns with the functional programming paradigm, making it easier to compose and reuse logic. It also integrates seamlessly with other hooks like `useEffect` for handling side effects related to state changes.
