# React JSX Exploration

This folder contains my practice code for learning JSX in React. The code includes:
- Creating elements using `React.createElement`
- Using JSX syntax for cleaner and more readable code
- Creating functional components
- Composing multiple components together

## Running the Code

To run this code, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1234` to see the application.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The entry point for the application.
- `index.js`: Contains the JSX practice code and component definitions.
- `icons/`: Contains image assets used in the application.
- `package.json`: Lists the project dependencies and scripts.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies which files and directories to ignore in version control.
- `.babelrc`: Babel configuration file.
