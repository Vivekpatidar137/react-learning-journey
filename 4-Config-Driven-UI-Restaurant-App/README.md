# 4-Config-Driven-UI-Restaurant-App

This project is a simple Restaurant Listing application built using ReactJS. The application displays a list of restaurants with details such as name, rating, cuisine, and cost for two. This project demonstrates several key React concepts:

1. **React Components**: Understanding the structure and behavior of functional components.
2. **JSX Syntax**: Using JSX to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.
3. **Props**: Passing data to components via props.
4. **JavaScript in React**: Utilizing JavaScript within React components for dynamic rendering.
5. **CSS Styling**: Applying styles to components using CSS.
6. **Keys**: Using keys to help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.
7. **Config-Driven UI**: Using real restaurant data to drive the UI configuration.

## Running the Code

To run this code, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1234` to see the application.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The entry point for the application.
- `style.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the application.
- `main.js`: Contains the ReactJS code for the application.
- `images/`: Contains the image assets used in the application.
- `package.json`: Lists the project dependencies and scripts.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies which files and directories to ignore in version control.
- `.babelrc`: Babel configuration file.
- `react-jsx-questions.md`: Contains detailed questions and answers about React and JSX concepts.

## Learning Objectives

- **React Components**: Learn how to create and use functional components.
- **JSX**: Understand how to use JSX for creating HTML-like structures within JavaScript.
- **Props**: Pass data to components via props for dynamic rendering.
- **JavaScript Integration**: Use JavaScript expressions within JSX for dynamic content.
- **Styling**: Apply CSS to style React components.
- **Keys**: Use keys in lists to help React manage DOM updates efficiently.
- **Config-Driven UI**: Implement a UI that is driven by real data (restaurant data), making the application dynamic and easily adjustable based on the data structure.
